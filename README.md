Hammerstone is a modding API and framework for the Sapiens video game. It aims to improve compatibility between mods and provide several useful features to mod developers. It has no functionality by itself. 

## Installing
Hammerstone has many different versions, and it can be installed a variety of ways.

### Steam Workshop
The Steam Workshop is the officially-supported way of installed Hammerstone. By going to it's [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840825226) and click 'Subscribe', the game will automatically download the mod for you.

### GitHub (manual)
